Like: it’s clean and simple. Property list on the right is nice.

Dislike: The font is pretty small and very wordy—“wall of text” to use your words

Arianna is a dynamic agent who sells a ton of stuff. She’s part of “The Hassell Team” so she doesn’t get credit for her own transactions.

Like AND Dislike: her photo

Interestingly, Keller Williams took down her ‘agent’ page that I liked.

Sandy is a very productive agent, and I like her as a person.

Like: her photo is prominent. Interesting mission statement

Dislike: photo at top looks like Chicago, not Kingman, and is therefore wasted space.

This is her brokerage’s page, so it’s more limited than what I could create with you.

I’ve worked with Brian on several transactions, and respect him.

Like: I like the simplicity of the page. I guess a white background doesn’t offend me…Chantal’s background is white too. Components are good too: Bio, Locations Served, Client Reviews, “Get in Touch” and Listings

Don’t know this guy, just looking for 5 people.

Like: Info Block on how to contact prominently displayed, bio.

Dislike: photo with no background feels weird, Contact fill-in portal at the right looks clunky. No links to ratings or listings. No idea what area he works in until you see his office info at the bottom of the page.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/cheryl-robertson  Linked In is a pain in the rear for me to keep up with. I’m not sure we’ll link to this one, but I do have a profile out there.

https://www.land.com/member/2798250/  I thought I built this one already. I’ll have to find it.

If we have to limit the links, my priority, in order, would be: Zillow, Facebook, Realtor.com, DRRE, then all the others

 

More later!
